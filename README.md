# dot_files
My OS dot files

these files created with lots of good guidance from many bloggers and githubbers:

this initial commit begins with my Mac OSX files - I will be using these to create and develop similar files for my Linux vm setups. (for the time being, these dotfiles are being used for all my linux installs, inc. my raspberry pi)

the files are by no means finished - realistically they never will be; there's always more one can do.

Any comments, suggestions, crits welcome.

Enjoy!
