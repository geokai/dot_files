# dot_files
My OS dot files

these files created with lots of good guidance from many bloggers and githubbers:

this initial commit begins with my Mac OSX files - I will be using these to create and develop similar files for my Linux vm setups.

the files are by no means finished - realistically they never will be; there's always more one can do.

Any comments, suggestions, crits welcome.

Enjoy!
